            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Building muscle and strength is a goal for many individuals who frequent the gym. It requires a well-structured workout routine that combines resistance training, proper nutrition, and consistency. In this article, we'll explore effective workout routines that can help you achieve your muscle and strength-building goals.</p>
                  
            <h2>1. Strength Training</h2>
            <p>Strength training is the foundation of any muscle-building workout routine. It involves lifting weights or using resistance to challenge your muscles. Key principles of strength training include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and overhead presses.</li>
              <li>Progressive overload â€“ gradually increasing the weight you lift over time.</li>
              <li>Adequate rest between sets to allow muscle recovery.</li>
            </ul>
                  
            <h2>2. Split Routines</h2>
            <p>Split routines are popular among bodybuilders and advanced lifters. They involve targeting specific muscle groups on different days of the week. Common split routines include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Push-Pull-Legs (PPL)</li>
              <li>Upper Body-Lower Body</li>
              <li>Chest and Triceps / Back and Biceps</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Full-Body Workouts</h2>
            <p>Full-body workouts are great for beginners and individuals with limited time. They target all major muscle groups in a single session. Key points for full-body workouts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Perform compound exercises to maximize muscle engagement.</li>
              <li>Workout 3-4 times per week with adequate rest between sessions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Nutrition is a crucial component of muscle and strength building. Your diet should include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Protein-rich foods like lean meats, fish, eggs, and dairy products.</li>
              <li>Complex carbohydrates for energy, such as whole grains, sweet potatoes, and brown rice.</li>
              <li>Healthy fats from sources like nuts, avocados, and olive oil.</li>
              <li>Adequate calorie intake to support muscle growth.</li>
            </ul>
                  
            <h2>5. Recovery and Rest</h2>
            <p>Recovery and rest are often underestimated. To maximize gains, you should:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Get 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.</li>
              <li>Include rest days in your workout routine to allow muscles to repair and grow.</li>
              <li>Consider stretching, yoga, or foam rolling to reduce muscle soreness and improve flexibility.</li>
            </ul>
